### Hi there 👋

I'm Nino, a construction engineer who transitioned into a developer from Bretagne in France. Ever since I was young, I have been passionate about building with my hands, understanding how things work in depth. My methodical mind finds satisfaction in coding because everything has to be in its place, well-organized, well-built, like a beautiful building's architecture.


Here's a glimpse into my professional life and personal interests:

- 🏗️ I’m currently laying my foundations. Over the past year, I have trained in web development, learning the basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, then specializing in React, Node.js for backend, and MongoDB for databases.
- 📈 Thanks to these skills and my fascination with the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, I pursued a blockchain developer course at Alyra, the leading French school in this field. I learned the Solidity language and to develope a decentralized application from A to Z, including securing and unit testing smart contracts, and creating a dynamic and responsive front end in React, with the Next.js framework that communicates directly with the blockchain and smart contracts.
- 🌱 I am currently continuing to improve my skills in these various web and blockchain languages and am starting to learn Rust to enhance my blockchain development skills, diving deep into how it can be used for creating more secure and efficient applications.
- 👯 I’m looking for employment or freelance opportunities. Filled with energy and ready to start after this months of learning, I am eager to work on innovative and modern projects. I am open to Web3 projects, cybersecurity projects, or modern web projects.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to blockchain, Ethereum, especially around traceability and NFTs, which are the areas I specialized in for my final blockchain developer certification project.
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop me an email at [your.email@example.com] or connect with me on LinkedIn.
- 🎯 Some of my main projects:
  - Tree Tracker - A blockchain-based traceability tool for agroforestry from seed harvest to tree planting.
  - Decentralized Voting System - A blockchain-based voting system to ensure transparency and security in elections.
  - Crypto App - A simple app to track cryptocurrency prices and view their trends.
